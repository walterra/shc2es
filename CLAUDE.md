This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Node.js project for collecting Bosch Smart Home device data via long polling, storing it as NDJSON, and visualizing as time series.

## Hardware

Based on the [Bosch Smart Home Controller II](https://www.bosch-smarthome.com/at/de/produkte/steuerung-und-zentrale/smart-home-controller/) - the central hub that connects and controls Bosch Smart Home devices.

## Project Status

This is a new project. The codebase structure and build commands will be documented here as development progresses.

## Planned Architecture

Based on the project description:
- **Data Collection**: Long polling from Bosch Smart Home API
- **Storage Format**: NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) files
- **Visualization**: Time series charts/graphs
